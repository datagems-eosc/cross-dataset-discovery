# Cross-Dataset Discovery in DataGEMS

This repository provides the implementation and tools for exploring **cross-dataset discovery** using the DataGEMS framework. It includes everything needed to download and preprocess the **MathE** and **language use-case** datasets, and to prepare them for compatibility with the discovery pipeline.

You'll also find a simple guide for dataset preparation and example scripts demonstrating how to run discovery tasks across datasets.
