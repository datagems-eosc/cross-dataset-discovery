# Cross-Dataset Discovery in DataGEMS

This repository contains the source code for performing **cross-dataset discovery** within the DataGEMS framework. It includes tools and instructions for downloading the **MathE** and **language use-case** datasets, along with a simple preprocessing pipeline.

Additionally, this repository provides a guide for preparing datasets to be compatible with the cross-dataset discovery functions, as well as example usage to help you get started quickly.
